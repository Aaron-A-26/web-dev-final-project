# web-dev-final-project

This repository contains files which demonstrate work done on a final project 
in my Web Application Development class in the FA 2020 semester at 
Florida Polytechnic University.

One of the options for the final project were to create a server-side calculator
using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
